  % This is the style that should be applied in the tree preamble. The problem
  % of citation nodes is that we effectively want to maintain two related
  % trees: the category tree and a tier-aligned citation tree. The idea
  % behind the implementation is the following: while packing a node of the
  % category tree, take the citation node children out and pack them
  % separately, pack the category node, put the citation nodes back in.
  categorized citations/.style={
    % #1 = citation box specification; see the example for details. As the spec
    % is a keylist, we parse it by processing it by pgfkeys in "/citation
    % tiers" path.  This code does three things (assume we are given spec
    %   "1=A,2=B,3=C"):
    % 
    % 1. An input style (actually, two) is defined for each box. For the
    % example spec, we'll get styles "1", "2" and "3" (and "1'", "2'",
    %   "3'"). When applied (by the user), this style creates a citation node as
    % a child of the category node residing on the appropriate tier.
    % 
    % 2. After the nodes are typeset, we create a "tier header": a chain of
    % auxiliary nodes containing the widest citation from each box. So if node
    % "citation 1/2/3" is the widest citation in citation box 1/2/3, the
    % tier header looks like this: % [citation 1 [citation 2 [citation 3]]].
    % These nodes are crucial for tier alignment; they are how we order the
    % tiers and thus the citation boxes.
    % 
    % 3. A dummy parent node is created for each tier/box. Just before a
    % category node is packed, its citation nodes are moved away to these
    % parent nodes (and packed there, nodes on each tier separately); after the
    % category node is packed, we bring the citation nodes back in.
    % 
    tempcounta'=0, % Initialize the box/tier counter.
    TeX={\pgfqkeys{/citation tiers}{#1}}, % Process the argument.
    % 
    % The "/citation tiers" code creates the tier header as a part of "typeset
    % nodes stage", after the actual typesetting (of course, as we need to know
    %   the citation node widths). So we have to typeset the tier header
    % separately. It resides in the last child of the current node.

    % This sets the separation between the citation boxes:
    l sep=1.25em,
    % (How so? The citation nodes get copied into the auxiliary "tier header"
    %   nodes, along with their "l sep" value. These nodes form a chain of
    %   embedded nodes, [1[2[3]]], so setting "l sep" on them pushes them apart
    %   in "l" (x") dimension. And because they live on the same tiers as the
    %   real citation nodes, those feel this "l sep" as well.)
    % 
    % The "anchor=parent" key specifies center vertical alignment to the
    % parent.  The "child anchor=paren" says that's where the edge will start
    % too. We most probably want to keep these as they are.
    anchor=parent, child anchor=parent,
    % The default citation node text width:
    text width=2cm,
    % (Note that a fixed text width is not a requirement for the
    %   "categorized citations" to work.  Try replacing the above
    %   "text width=..." by:
    %   anchor=center
    %   
    %   Automatically format content of citation nodes. We offer two
    %   mechanisms; you can also implement your own, or use none (just comment
    %     this out).
    %   1. Wrap in \cite
    %   content format=\cite{\forestoption{content}},
    %   2. Split the content of the node (separator is ",") and format the
    %   parts according to "format (first) citation entry".
    %   split option={content}{,}{format first citation entry, format citation entry},
    if citation node autoformat={
      split option={content}{,}{format first citation entry, format citation entry},
    }{},
    % Make sure that the edge to a citation is a simple line.
    before drawing tree={edge path'={(!u.parent anchor)--(.child anchor)}},
  },
  % These two keys are used (by the second content formatting mechanism above)
  % to build (new) content by concatenating the formatted parts (of the old
  %   content).
  format first citation entry/.style={content'=\mbox{[#1]}},
  format citation entry/.style={content+'=\discretionary{}{}{}\mbox{[#1]}},
  % How shall we align citations in the unlikely case that we have more than
  % one citation node belonging to a category node on a single tier (see the
  %   blue "citation" in the example tree)? Let's have a very fancy setup by
  % default: center calignment with forked edges, but no "s sep". The
  % following style is applied to a dummy parent where the packing of the
  % citation nodes actually takes place:
  citation nodes calign/.style={
    calign=center, forked edges, for children={fork sep=2em}, s sep=0,
    % To push the citation boxes a bit further away from the tree, adjust the
    % "l sep" of the dummy parent:
    l sep=1.0em,
  },
  % How should a citation box look like? Note that we want "fill opacity=1"
  % (the default) here, because we want the citation box to partially hide the
  % edges from citations to the folders.
  /tikz/citation box options/.style={
    fill=gray!5, draw=black, dotted, thin,
  },
  % Format the citation box labels:
  /tikz/citation box label options/.style={
    anchor=base, yshift=1ex,
  },
  % Where should the citation box labels appear?
  citation box label position=north,
  citation node autoformat=false, % manually changed from true to false!
