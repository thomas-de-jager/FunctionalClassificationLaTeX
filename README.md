A proposed functional classification scheme for sytematic literature reviews, using LaTeX.
The file is working properly in Overleaf at the time of writing. main.tex can be imported directly to e.g. Overleaf.
The code is made with the help of the tex.stackexchange community: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/567434/tikz-tree-diagram-classification-with-functional-levels
